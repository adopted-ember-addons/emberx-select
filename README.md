A Select component based on the native html select.

Why a select component? Because `Ember.Select` is hard to use, and
really, all you want to do is just use a `<select>` tag dammit. The
only difference is that you want value of the options to be any object
and not just a string.

By allowing arbitrary html to appear in the template of the select
element, you can use it just like you would normally. This means
things like having `<optgroup>` tags inside your select, or even plain
old `<option>` elements to represent things like empty values.

XSelect thinly wraps a native `<select>` element so that it can be object
and binding aware. It is used in conjuction with the `x-option`
component to construct select boxes. E.g.

```handlebars
{{#x-select value=bob action="selectPerson"}}
  {{#x-option value=fred}}Fred Flintstone{{/x-option}}
  {{#x-option value=bob}}Bob Newhart{{/x-option}}
{{/x-select}}
```

the options are always up to date, so that when the object bound to
`value` changes, the corresponding option becomes selected.

Whenever the select tag receives a change event, it will fire
`action`

### Multiselect

As of version 1.1.0, `emberx-select` supports the `multiple`
option. This means you can pass an array as its value, and it will set
its selections directly on that array.

```handlebars
{{#x-select value=selections multiple=true action="selectionsChanged"}}
 {{#x-option value=fred}}Fred Flintstone{{/x-option}}
 {{#x-option value=bob}}Bob Newhart{{/x-option}}
 {{#x-option value=andrew}}Andrew WK{{/x-option}}
{{/x-select}}
```

The selections array will be initialized to an empty array if not present.

> Heads Up! This will mutate the contents of your value array as the
> user changes their selections. This can lead to strange behavior and
> inconsistencies if you are using computed arrays and/or ember-data
> `hasMany` relationships. Just remember, you can't go wrong if you
> use just a simple array.

### Test Helpers

Since `emberx-select` uses internal identifiers as the `value` attribute, it
doesn't integrate with the `fillIn` test helper. But don't fret, we've automatically
injected the test helper into your app.

#### Using the test helper

As of version 1.1.3 we support both multiselects and regular selects. To use you
need to specify the class on the on the select as the first argument and the rest
of the arguments are the options you'd like to select. For example:

```js
//... Single select
  select('.my-drop-down', 'My Option');
//...
```

Multiselect
```js
//... Multiselect
  select('.my-drop-down', 'My Option', 'My Option Two', 'My Option Three');
//...
```

#### Why am I getting a JSHint error?

You need to run the generator: `ember g emberx-select`

#### Why am I getting a "Can't find variable: select" error?

You need to either run the generator (`ember g emberx-select`) or import the test helper into your
`test-helper.js` file:

```js
import registerSelectHelper from './helpers/register-select-helper';
registerSelectHelper();
```

## Blockless Form

As of version 1.1.2, `x-select` can be invoked in a blockless form
which is API compatible with `Ember.SelectView`. While most of the
time you want to use it in block-form, there are some cases where it
makes more sense to specify your select on a single line. Also, it
makes a more incremental approach to migrating from `SelectView` possible.

```handlebars
{{x-select action="tagYouAreIt" disabled=isDisabled
  multiple=true
  content=folks
  value=it
  optionValuePath="content.id"
  optionLabelPath="content.name"}}
```

## Action and Action Arguments

The action that is dispatched by x-select whenever the selected value or values
change has a function signature of:



```js
/**
* @param value {Object} the value selected by the user.
* @param component {Ember.Component} the x-select component itself
*/
function (value, component) {
  // action body...
}
```

Most of the time all you need is the value that has been selected, but
sometimes your action requires more context than just that. In those
cases, you can associate arbitrary attributes with the component
itself and use them later inside your action handler.  For example:

```handlebars
{{#x-select action="didMakeSelection" default=anything}}
  <option>Nothing</option>
  {{#x-option value=something}}Something{{/x-option}}
{{/x-select}}
```
then, inside your action handler:

```js
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  actions: {
    didMakeSelection: function(selection, component) {
      if (selection) {
        this.set('selection', selection)
      } else {
        this.set('selection', component.get('default'))
      }
    }
  }
});
```
